        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><em>Last updated: June 15, 2025</em></p>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how our application (“the App”) handles your information. We are committed to
            protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.</p>

        <h3>2. Offline-Only Operation</h3>
        <p>The App operates entirely offline. It does not require an internet connection for its core functionality and
            does not transmit any data to external servers or third parties.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Collection</h3>
        <p><strong>No Data Collected:</strong><br>
            The App does not collect, store, or process any personal data or usage information. No information is
            gathered about you, your device, or your usage of the App.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p><strong>No Data Shared:</strong><br>
            Since the App does not collect any data, there is no information to share with third parties, service
            providers, or affiliates.</p>

        <h3>5. Data Deletion</h3>
        <p><strong>No Data to Delete:</strong><br>
            As the App does not collect or store any personal data, there is no data to delete. You do not need to make
            any requests for data deletion.</p>

        <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>The App does not collect any information from users, including children under the age of 13, and is compliant
            with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations.</p>

        <h3>7. Compliance with Laws</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations, including but not
            limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other
            relevant data protection laws. Since no data is collected, most requirements of these laws do not apply.</p>

        <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on our
            website, with the updated date indicated above.</p>
